# Navidrome Replacement

Navidrome Replacement is a self-hosted music app for browsing local library content and listening to live radio streams.

## Language

### Library

**Personal Music Server**:
A self-hosted Music Server operated for one person's library in the initial product. Future user profiles may isolate multiple personal libraries, but the initial product is not a shared or multi-tenant music host.
_Avoid_: Public music server, multi-tenant library

**Managed Import**:
A user-initiated transfer in which a Playback Client uploads an audio file and the Music Server retains an authoritative managed copy after validation and explicit confirmation.
_Avoid_: Folder scan, referenced file, automatic import

**Local Folder Import**:
A Managed Import initiated by selecting a directory on a Playback Client and recursively uploading its supported contents. The client directory and its hierarchy are not retained as a library source or storage structure.
_Avoid_: folder scan, preserved folder hierarchy

**Managed Storage**:
The Music Server-owned location that holds one authoritative audio file per Track in its Source Audio Format and one extracted artwork file per Album.
_Avoid_: Source folder, Playlist folder, symlink view

**Bit-Preserving Storage**:
Managed Storage that retains the exact uploaded audio-file bytes and verifies them by full-file SHA-256 before and after canonical placement. It does not imply an end-to-end bit-perfect Playback guarantee.
_Avoid_: Transcoded storage, rewritten tags, bit-perfect Playback guarantee

**Import Preview**:
The validation result shown before a Managed Import is committed. It identifies accepted and rejected files without creating library content until the user confirms.
_Avoid_: Completed import, scan result

**Strict Import Profile**:
The fallback-free metadata, artwork, and audio-integrity contract used by Managed Import. A file that fails any required condition is rejected without synthesizing missing values or granting legacy exceptions.
_Avoid_: Best-effort scan, legacy exception, filename fallback

**Import Batch**:
A user-selected group of files processed through one Import Preview. Each selected file commits independently, so one failure does not roll back files already imported successfully.
_Avoid_: Atomic batch, folder scan, Playlist

**Import History**:
The retained results of the most recent Managed Imports without their staged audio files. It supports reviewing outcomes but not resuming or restoring an import.
_Avoid_: Staging storage, retry queue, library history

**Possible Duplicate**:
A proposed import whose metadata resembles an existing Track but whose full-file content hash differs. It requires an explicit user choice and never causes automatic replacement.
_Avoid_: Exact duplicate, automatic replacement

**Exact Duplicate**:
A proposed import whose full-file content hash matches an existing Track. It is rejected without changing library state, regardless of its client filename or source location.
_Avoid_: Possible Duplicate, same title, same recording

**Source Audio Format**:
The audio file's existing supported format, which a Managed Import preserves without transcoding.
_Avoid_: Import format, normalized format

**Artist**:
A credited performer associated with a Track, an Album, or both. Structured multi-value credits create ordered Artist relationships without guessing from punctuation inside a display credit.
_Avoid_: Album Artist, free-text artist label, Composer

**Album Artist**:
The Artist credit under which an Album is grouped. It is required independently from each Track's Artist credit and is never inferred from it.
_Avoid_: Track Artist, fallback Artist, Composer

**Album**:
A release grouping of Tracks under an Album Artist and stable Album identity. Similar titles or editions require explicit matching rather than automatic merging when their known release metadata conflicts.
_Avoid_: Playlist, folder, import batch

**Album Artwork**:
The validated front-cover image embedded in every Track of an Album edition. Accepted Tracks in that Album carry byte-identical artwork, from which the Music Server extracts one display copy without modifying the audio files.
_Avoid_: External cover upload, folder artwork, inferred picture

**Track**:
A library item backed by one authoritative playable audio source. Playlist and genre membership reference the Track without creating additional audio-file copies.
_Avoid_: File copy, playlist entry, Radio Station

**Managed Track**:
A Track backed by a Music Server-owned audio file in Managed Storage.
_Avoid_: client-local file

**Genre**:
A normalized classification referenced by one or more Tracks. An Album's displayed Genres are derived from its active Tracks without copying audio files.
_Avoid_: Playlist, folder, symlink view

**Track Replacement**:
An explicit user-confirmed change of a Track's managed audio file that preserves the Track's identity and adopts the replacement file's validated metadata. A Possible Duplicate never triggers Track Replacement automatically.
_Avoid_: Exact duplicate, automatic replacement, separate import

**Canonical Library Path**:
A Music Server-generated, human-readable Managed Storage path whose stable IDs determine identity while metadata-derived slugs aid inspection. Client filenames and folder hierarchies never determine it.
_Avoid_: Client path, identity-by-filename, source hierarchy

**Playlist**:
A user-created named collection of library Tracks. Managed Imports do not create Playlists automatically.
_Avoid_: Album, genre, import batch, Queue

**Permanent Track Deletion**:
An irreversible removal of both a Track and its managed audio file from the Music Server.
_Avoid_: Remove from Playlist, hide Track, trash

### Playback

**Music Server**:
The authoritative source for library content and user-shared data. It serves Playback Clients but does not produce sound for them.
_Avoid_: Player, Playback Client, audio device

**Server Connection**:
The Desktop Client's configured relationship to one Music Server URL. The initial product does not discover servers or retain an offline library.
_Avoid_: Server Profile, local server, offline library

**Local-only Deployment**:
A Music Server deployment bound to the local machine's loopback interface. The initial product does not authenticate Playback Clients and cannot be reached from other devices.
_Avoid_: LAN deployment, internet-ready deployment, trusted client identity

**Server Capability**:
A named behavior advertised by a Music Server so a Playback Client can adapt when their release versions differ.
_Avoid_: Client version, feature assumption

**Playback Client**:
An app instance on a user device that browses the Music Server and plays audio on that device. Web Client and Desktop Client are Playback Client variants.
_Avoid_: Music Server, UI, frontend

**Web Client**:
A Playback Client used through a web browser. Its playback remains local to the browser's device.
_Avoid_: Desktop Client, server player

**Desktop Client**:
An installed Playback Client with native playback capability. It connects to a separate Music Server and does not contain or start one.
_Avoid_: Music Server, standalone server, web wrapper

**Player**:
The audio engine local to a Playback Client. Each Playback Client owns its Player and playback position independently.
_Avoid_: Music Server, Playback Client, queue

**Native Playback**:
Playback performed by the Desktop Client's local Player through the host operating system's audio facilities.
_Avoid_: Browser playback, server playback

**Output Mode**:
The device-local routing policy used by a Native Player: System Output, Direct ALSA Output, or Adaptive System Rate.
_Avoid_: Processing Profile, Output Device

**Processing Profile**:
The device-local signal-processing policy used independently from Output Mode: Direct Profile or Processed Profile.
_Avoid_: Output Mode, audio route

**Direct Profile**:
A Native Playback profile that keeps software volume at unity and disables ReplayGain, EQ, and other signal processing while seeking a source-to-output format match.
_Avoid_: Bit-perfect guarantee, Processed Profile

**Processed Profile**:
A Native Playback profile that permits software volume, ReplayGain, EQ, or other transformations of the decoded signal.
_Avoid_: Direct Profile, format-preserving playback

**Format Match**:
An observed match between decoded source parameters and parameters written to the operating system audio interface, with no known signal processing enabled. It is evidence of a direct path, not proof of mathematically bit-identical DAC output.
_Avoid_: Bit-perfect guarantee, source quality

**System Output**:
The default Native Playback output mode in which the Player submits source parameters to PipeWire and PipeWire decides the graph and device formats.
_Avoid_: Direct ALSA Output, guaranteed format match

**Direct ALSA Output**:
An advanced Native Playback output mode that opens a selected ALSA `hw:` Output Device without PipeWire or ALSA conversion plugins. Device availability and exact source-format support determine whether playback can start.
_Avoid_: PipeWire exclusive mode, guaranteed device availability

**Adaptive System Rate**:
A Native Playback output mode that temporarily forces the local PipeWire graph to each Playback Source's sample rate and therefore changes processing for every application on the device.
_Avoid_: Bitrate matching, bit-depth matching, isolated application setting

**Playback Telemetry**:
The separately reported source, decoder, system graph, Output Device, and active processing parameters used to explain whether conversion or processing is known to occur. Unknown device information remains explicitly unknown rather than being inferred from source metadata.
_Avoid_: Generic quality badge, bit-perfect proof

**ReplayGain Metadata**:
Track or album loudness adjustment metadata owned by a library Track and indexed by the Music Server. Its availability is separate from whether a Playback Client enables ReplayGain.
_Avoid_: Player preference, volume setting, inferred loudness

**Playback Source**:
Content a Player can load, currently a library Track, saved Radio Station, or Catalog Preview.
_Avoid_: Queue item, playlist, Output Device

**Playback Parity**:
The promise that Web and Desktop Clients can play the same Playback Sources even though their Players use different audio engines.
_Avoid_: Identical audio engine, shared Playback Session

**Playback Session**:
The transient, device-local state of one Player, including the current item, playhead, play/pause state, volume, shuffle, and repeat mode.
_Avoid_: Queue, playlist, shared playback state

**Playback Session Snapshot**:
The device-local record used to restore the last item and playhead in a paused state after the Desktop Client relaunches or to recover once from a Player crash.
_Avoid_: Shared playback state, automatic playback

**Background Playback**:
Continuation of the Desktop Client's Playback Session after its main window closes. An explicit application quit ends the session.
_Avoid_: Server playback, remote playback

**Queue**:
A user-owned ordered list of library Tracks shared across that user's Playback Clients. Each Player consumes the shared Queue through its own independent Playback Session.
_Avoid_: Playlist, Playback Session, play history

**Queue Synchronization**:
Propagation of Queue changes to every active Playback Client without synchronizing their independent Playback Sessions.
_Avoid_: Playback synchronization, shared playhead

**Queue Revision**:
The version of a Queue state used to detect and reject mutations based on stale data.
_Avoid_: Track position, Playback Session version

**Output Device**:
The audio endpoint on the Playback Client's device through which its Player produces sound.
_Avoid_: Playback Client, Music Server, stream source

### Radio

**Radio Station**:
A user-specific, user-managed or imported live internet audio stream. It is not a local library track and does not have stable per-track ownership in the app.
_Avoid_: Channel, radio track, stream item

**Imported Radio Station**:
A Radio Station copied from an external directory into the local collection. After import, the local copy is the source of truth.
_Avoid_: Remote station, live catalog item

**Radio Browser Catalog Entry**:
A discoverable external internet radio listing returned by Radio Browser. It can be previewed or imported, but it is not a local Radio Station until import succeeds.
_Avoid_: Radio Station, saved station, local stream

**Radio Browser Catalog Option**:
A country or tag/genre option proxied from Radio Browser for discover filtering. Country options use Radio Browser's ISO country code when available so the UI can render a flag next to the country name.
_Avoid_: Local filter preset, saved preference

**Catalog Preview**:
Temporary Live Playback of a Radio Browser Catalog Entry before import. It lets the user audition the stream without creating a local Radio Station.
_Avoid_: Auto-import, saved playback, library playback

**AAC Family**:
Discover filter meaning AAC and AAC+ catalog entries. Users expect AAC to include AAC+ because Radio Browser reports both as closely related codec labels.
_Avoid_: Exact AAC-only filter

**Local Station Health**:
Reachability status measured by this app for a saved Radio Station. It is separate from Radio Browser's catalog health because manual stations do not have external directory metadata.
_Avoid_: Radio Browser health, stream quality, Now Playing

**Radio Browser Health**:
Directory metadata from Radio Browser such as last successful check. It is useful for ranking confidence but does not guarantee that the stream will play through the browser or this app at preview time.
_Avoid_: Playback guarantee, local station health

**Live Playback**:
Playback of an unbounded radio stream. It is separate from queue playback because it has no fixed duration, stable track list, or seek target.
_Avoid_: Queue playback, radio queue item

**Now Playing**:
Current program or song metadata reported by a Radio Station while its live stream is playing. It is advisory metadata, not a local library Track, and may be stale or absent.
_Avoid_: Track, queued track, library metadata
